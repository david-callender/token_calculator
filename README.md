## Frontend

### Stack

-   Package Manager - [Bun](https://bun.com/)
-   Framework - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-   Styling - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   Formatter - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
-   Linter - [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)

### Getting started

-   In a terminal, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/david-callender/FoodFinder.git`. This will create a folder called `FoodFinder` in the current working directory.
-   Install bun from [here](https://bun.com/). You will have to completely restart your shell or VSCode for any `bun` commands to work.
-   Run `bun install` to install all required packages.
-   Run `bun pm trust --all` to trust installed packages.
-   Create a `.env` file with the structure defined below.
-   Run `bun dev` to start the dev server.

### Envirnoment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` folder that contains the following data, where `YOUR-KEY` can be anything, as long as it matches the backend.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
access_key=YOUR-KEY
refresh_key=YOUR-KEY
```

### Before you push

-   Run `bun lint` to lint your code for common issues.
-   Run `bun format` to format your code.

## Backend

### Stack

-   Language [Go](https://go.dev/)
-   API [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)

### Environment Variables

#### .ENV
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder that contains the following data, where `YOUR-KEY` can be anything, as long as it matches the frontend.

```env
access_key=YOUR-KEY
refresh_key=YOUR-KEY
```

#### jsonv2

The `dineocclient` package uses the `encodings/json/v2` API. Currently, this
library is not available unless you set the following environment variable prior
to builds: `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2`

To set this environment variable on powershell, use the following command:

`$env:GOEXPERIMENT="jsonv2"`

Using this command will set the environment variable for the rest of your
powreshell session.

In bash, you can use the following command:

`export GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2`

Other *nix shells will have similar syntax, if you aren't using bash then you can
look up specific methods to set variables in your particular shell.

### Utils
The go.mod files of all current modules, and any new modules, should be set up with
`replace github.com/david-callender/FoodFinder/utils => ../utils` to allow any libraries
within utils to be used as dependencies across all modules in the project.

### Notifier
The module `notifier` located at `/notifier` from the root of the project
reads its sending address as `NOTIFIER_EMAIL`, its SMTP password as
`NOTIFIER_PASSWORD`, and the database connection string as `DATABASE_URL`. The
notifier should not generally be run from dev machines without prior discussion.
However, you must make sure to set these environment variables before running
it or else you will get an error.

Make sure run `go get .` in the `notifier` directory as well.

### Scraper
The module `scraper` located at `/scraper` from the root of the project also
reads the database connections tring as `DATABASE_URL`. It can take arguments
in the form of `-back N` and `-forward N` which specify the number of days in
the past and future to scrape. It will delete all menu data that is older than
the furthest day in the past that will be scraped based on specified values.

### Getting started

-   Install Go.
-   Run `go get .` to install packages.
-   Run `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest` to install air.
-   Run `air` to start the dev server.

### Before you push

-   Run `go fmt .` format your code.
